As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, I've generated this analysis report for city officials. The timeframe for this the data analysis report is from February 2021 to April 2022 and these are the phenomenons I uncovered from the data:

Until May 2021, the only available type of bikes were docked ones with a total of 90,821 rides starting February 2021, but with the introduction of classic and electric bikes this number dropped down to 1,328 as of April 2022.
This may be due to the new bikes having a pedal-assist technology that gives you a higher speed, up to 18 mph, thus helping riders move faster and tackle bridges, and also being able to unlock e-bikes anywhere in the city.

As a consequence of the first phenomena, except for the month of June where 21,077 members rode the docked bikes, for the rest of 2021 the very few docked bike rides were taken only by casual riders.
This shows the preference of CitiBike members, and that docked bikes have becomes an outdated means of transport.
Another occurrence is the number of members being higher than the casual ones, this may be due to the Covid-19 pandemic transforming the delivery business. With most workplaces shutting down, people had to find a way to make ends meet, and becoming a delivery personnel was one of the few choices; actually turning riders into frontline workers. So, as delivering becomes people's main job, they become members to gain the benefits offered by CitiBike.

My recommendations:

•Replacing all docked bikes with either classic or electric bikes, making more classic and electric bikes available,
•Replacing all docking stations with charging stations, tackling the plug-in problem.

In conclusion, this will help increase the number of bikes available, satisfy CitiBike's members, reduce traffic congestion and carbon footprint better, solve the charging station problem, and increase CitiBike's financial gain as membership rises.
